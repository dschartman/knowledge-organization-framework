## Observations

- Human knowledge typically enters as expressions (conversations, documents, thoughts put into words)
- Thoughts are "free form" until articulated as expressions
- Communication between individuals requires expression
- When we interface between human and computer, that comes as expression
- Expressions are constantly the input—this is natural, not problematic
- The framework methodology itself started as an expression (conversation, then document)
- Learning something thoroughly enough to teach it requires breaking it down into components
- To explain something well, you must understand its constituent concepts
- The framework process mirrors deep learning: absorb expression → extract components → synthesize new understanding
- Starting with "messy expression" and distilling it is the normal flow, not an exception
- You cannot always start with pristine substrate—real work begins with existing expressions that need organization

## Context

This insight emerged when discussing whether it was "ironic" that we wrote framework documentation without first creating substrate/essence. The realization: expression-as-input is THE reality of knowledge work. The framework helps you take expressions and organize them systematically, not start from zero with perfect substrate.

This reframes the framework's value: it's not about avoiding expressions or starting from substrate. It's about taking the expressions you naturally create and organizing them for clarity, traceability, and multiple uses.
