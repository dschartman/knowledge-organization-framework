## Observations

- There is often confusion between "observation" and "opinion" in practice
- Example: "Liberals lack emotional control" presented as observation but is actually an interpretation/opinion
- Example: "Conservatives don't show empathy" presented as observation but is actually an interpretation/opinion
- These statements reflect interpretations and claims, not verified facts
- True observations would be: "In this sample of 100 statements from liberal commentators, X% included emotional language" (measurable fact)
- True observations require verifiable evidence, specific context, measurable criteria
- Opinions are interpretations that derive from observations but add judgment, bias, or values
- Both observations and opinions can exist in the framework, but they belong in different layers

## Clarification on Substrate Content

- Substrate contains knowledge and wisdom
- Knowledge: things that change over time (current facts, current understandings)
- Wisdom: things that do not change over time (principles, underlying truths)
- Both knowledge and wisdom are appropriate substrate
- The key distinction: substrate is verifiable, observable, factual (even if that fact is "this statement was made on this date by this person")

## Where Opinions Belong

- Opinions should be organized as essence, not substrate
- Essence captures interpretation, claims, and judgment derived from substrate
- Essence evolves as understanding grows
- Substrate remains stable (append-only)
- This maintains clarity and framework integrity

## Implications for Use

- Clear separation prevents substrate from becoming contaminated with unsupported claims
- Essence layer honestly captures interpretations and their evolution
- Framework users can see exactly what is verified fact vs. what is interpretation
- This is especially important for contested domains (politics, health, etc.) where bias and agenda are present
