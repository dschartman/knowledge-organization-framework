## Observations

- The framework emphasizes traceability (lineage: statement → interpretation → source)
- However, verifiability is more important than traceability as a concept
- Verifiability: Can this claim be validated against substrate/essence?
- Traceability: Can you see the path/lineage of how we got here?
- Traceability is a tool that enables verifiability, not the primary goal
- Overemphasizing traceability can make the framework feel overly prescriptive about HOW to organize (IDs, naming, lineage paths)

## The Distinction

- Verifiability focuses on the substance: Is this true? Can it be checked against source material?
- Traceability focuses on the mechanism: Can you see the line from source to claim?
- Both are valuable, but verifiability is primary
- Implementation of traceability varies by context (IDs, links, narrative explanations, all valid)

## Application to Boundary Contracts

- Substrate → Essence contract: Essential claim must be verifiable against substrate (not necessarily traceable by ID)
- Essence → Expression contract: Expression must be verifiable against essence (not necessarily show exact lineage)
- The question is always: "Is this true to the source material?" not "Can you show every step?"

## Philosophical Implication

- Framework is about understanding and validation, not about tracking chains
- Users should focus on: Can I verify this claim is grounded in reality/substrate?
- Not: Can I see every link in the chain?
- This distinction keeps the framework flexible and applicable across different organizational approaches
