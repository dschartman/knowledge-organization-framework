## Observations

- A 15-year career generates a large volume of factual items (projects, accomplishments, skills, dates, metrics, responsibilities)
- A typical resume is constrained to 1-2 pages
- Resume writing requires selecting and abstracting a subset of career facts
- Different job applications require different emphasis from the same career facts
- Example: Same career history could produce "data engineer resume" vs "software engineer resume" vs "streaming-focused resume"
- Traceability from resume claims to actual work is desirable (prevents unsupported assertions)
- Resume recipients cannot verify claims without traceability to evidence
- Career facts remain stable over time; resumes need to adapt for different audiences
- The same factual career history can support multiple different professional narratives
- Resume writing is not "fixing a broken resume" but organizing career knowledge to generate targeted communications

## Context

Resume example emerged as primary concrete illustration of framework value during initial design conversations. It makes abstract framework concepts tangible because everyone understands:
1. The gap between "everything you've done" and "what fits on a resume"
2. The need to adapt presentation for different audiences
3. The importance of supporting claims with actual experience
