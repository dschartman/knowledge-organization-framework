## Observations

- The primary audience for this knowledge organization skill is an LLM (Claude)
- LLMs need clear, explicit instruction on how to apply frameworks
- LLMs work best with concrete examples that show application
- LLMs need to understand the "why" before applying the "how"
- LLMs benefit from explicit concept dependencies stated upfront
- LLMs can handle complexity if structure is clear and hierarchical
- The goal is for an LLM to read the skill and be able to:
  1. Understand the framework's core concepts
  2. Identify when to apply it (what problems it solves)
  3. Know how to apply it (process and steps)
  4. Generate better outputs using it

## Information Architecture for LLM Consumption

- Start with the most important concept (what it does, why it matters)
- Build outward to supporting concepts and details
- Use explicit section headers to mark shifts in conceptual territory
- Provide examples early so abstract concepts have concrete grounding
- Explain dependencies between concepts ("Understand X before Y")
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Clarify edge cases and anti-patterns

## What Makes a Skill Effective for LLMs

- Clear statement of what problem it solves
- Explicit description of when to use it (triggers, contexts)
- Core concepts explained with minimal jargon
- Theory explained before application
- Examples that illuminate core concepts
- Step-by-step application guidance
- Recognition of different use cases
- Honest limitation acknowledgment
