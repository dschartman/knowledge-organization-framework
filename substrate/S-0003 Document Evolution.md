## Observations

- Documents that are edited incrementally over time tend to become bloated
- Repeated patching of existing prose accumulates cruft
- Incremental edits can cause structural confusion as original organization breaks down
- The "telephone game" effect: meaning drifts further from original truth with each successive edit
- Patching individual sentences doesn't address systemic organizational problems
- Long-lived documents often become repetitive as editors add without removing
- Finding and updating all instances of outdated information across a document is error-prone
- Documents can become "structurally confused" where the organization no longer matches the content
- Rebuilding from scratch can be clearer than continuing to patch
- But rebuilding loses valuable information if not done systematically

## Context

These observations motivated the initial "regenerative" framing of the framework. However, we later clarified that document regeneration is one capability, not the primary purpose. The underlying issue is lack of separation between facts, meaning, and presentationâ€”which causes degradation over time.
