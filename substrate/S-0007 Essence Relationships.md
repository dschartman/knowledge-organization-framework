## Observations

- To effectively teach a topic, you need to understand the relationships between different concepts
- Order matters when explaining concepts: explaining concept B before concept A fails if B depends on A
- People become overwhelmed with information when concepts are explained out of order
- Understanding concept dependencies is critical for coherent explanation
- Relationships between concepts are as important as the concepts themselves
- Teaching effectiveness depends on proper sequencing based on dependencies
- The essence layer should capture not just isolated claims, but how claims relate to each other
- Concept dependencies form a directed graph: some concepts must be understood before others
- Random ordering of valid information can make it incomprehensible
- Building knowledge requires foundation → intermediate → advanced progression
- This applies beyond teaching: decision-making, strategic planning, any coherent reasoning

## Context

This observation emerged when reviewing what's missing from current framework documentation. The essence layer was described as containing "claims" and "principles" but not explicitly addressing relationships and ordering—yet these are critical for any expression to be coherent.

The political views example illustrates this: it's not enough to have isolated political principles; you need to understand how they relate and which ones take priority in conflicts.

## Implications

- Essence layer definition needs to explicitly include relationships and ordering
- Graph structure is inherent to essence, not just a representation choice
- Expressions fail when they don't respect the ordering implied by essence relationships
- Teaching, documentation, decision frameworks all depend on proper relationship capture in essence
