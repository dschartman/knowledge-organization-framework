## Observations

- Initial framing positioned framework as "rebuilding bloated, repetitive, or structurally confused documents"
- This framing is too narrow and reactive; implies framework is primarily for fixing broken documents
- Framework is actually more fundamental: organizing knowledge with separation of concerns
- Three layers separate: what you know (substrate), what it means (essence), how you communicate it (expression)
- Writing is one form of expression, but not the only form
- Expression can also be: decisions, actions, principles applied in practice, strategic choices
- Resume example demonstrates proactive use: organizing career facts → extracting meaning → generating tailored communications (not fixing broken resume)
- Regeneration is a capability enabled by the framework, not the primary purpose
- Knowledge organization creates value even without producing expression artifacts
- Framework can be used for: systematic writing, decision-making frameworks, research synthesis, personal knowledge management, product strategy
- Separation of concerns (facts/meaning/communication) is the core organizational principle
- Writing methodology emerges as a symptom of proper knowledge organization

## Clarifications

- **Primary purpose**: Knowledge organization with separation of concerns
- **Secondary capabilities**: Systematic writing, decision-making, knowledge synthesis, regeneration
- **Core value**: Structured, traceable knowledge that can be applied in multiple ways
- **Expression includes**: Documents, decisions, actions, strategic choices, principles-in-practice

## Questions Raised

- Should framework be named "Regenerative Writing Framework" if writing is just one application?
- Is "regenerative" creating confusion by implying repair/rebuild focus?
- Framework naming should reflect knowledge organization as core purpose

## Preferred Framing (from conversation)

**Simple version**: "A framework for organizing knowledge with separation of concerns: what you know, what it means, and how you communicate it."

**Extended version**: "A knowledge organization framework that separates facts, meaning, and communication—enabling systematic writing, decision-making, and knowledge synthesis."
