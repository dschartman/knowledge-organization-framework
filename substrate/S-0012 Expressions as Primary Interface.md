## Observations

- Everything humans interact with is an expression of some kind
- Conversations are expressions
- Documents are expressions
- News articles are expressions
- Feedback and requests are expressions
- In the modern world, humans are constantly bombarded with expressions
- Many modern expressions are emotionally driven rather than fact-driven
- Expression-driven agenda can obscure the factual substrate and interpretive claims

## The Unnatural but Valuable Activity

- The framework asks people to do something unnatural: decompose expressions into components
- Normally we interact with expressions as whole units
- Breaking them down (substrate, essence, expression) is artificial but valuable
- This decomposition enables systematic understanding and regeneration

## Use Case: News Article Analysis

- News articles are expressions with embedded substrate (facts) and essence (interpretations/agenda)
- Many news organizations are owned by entities with specific agendas
- News articles often contain emotional framing that obscures factual accuracy
- Using the framework on a news article:
  1. Extract substrate: What are the verifiable facts presented?
  2. Extract essence: What are the interpretations, claims, and implied narratives?
  3. Evaluate: Where is the bias? What's strong substrate? What's weak/unsupported?
  4. Regenerate: Create a version with clearer separation of fact from interpretation

## Framework as Decomposition Tool

- Primary value: taking expressions (primary interface) and decomposing them
- Secondary value: using organized substrate/essence to create better new expressions
- The framework works backwards (expression → substrate/essence) as much as forwards (substrate/essence → expression)
- Understanding the anatomy of biased expressions helps identify and counteract manipulation

## Clarity on Starting Points

- Starting with expressions is normal and expected
- The framework is not violated by beginning with an expression
- Decomposing expressions is the natural entry point for most use cases
- Working backwards (from expression to components) is as valid as working forwards
