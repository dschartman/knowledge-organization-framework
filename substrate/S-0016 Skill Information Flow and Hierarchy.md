## Observations

- Effective skills have a clear information flow from abstract to concrete
- The flow should enable an LLM to learn and apply progressively
- Too much introductory material before core concepts loses focus
- Too little context before examples creates confusion

## Effective Information Flow

1. **What and Why** (Intro)
   - What does this skill do?
   - Why would you use it?
   - What problem does it solve?

2. **Core Concepts** (Foundation)
   - Core idea or framework
   - Key components
   - How they relate to each other
   - Why this structure matters

3. **Contracts or Boundaries** (Rules)
   - What are the non-negotiables?
   - What are the boundaries between concepts?
   - What breaks the framework?

4. **How to Apply** (Process)
   - Step-by-step application
   - What to do at each step
   - What to watch for
   - How to know you're doing it right

5. **Variations and Contexts** (Depth)
   - Different use cases
   - How framework adapts to different contexts
   - When to deviate

6. **Principles and Philosophy** (Meta)
   - What values guide this?
   - What are the trade-offs?
   - What mindset matters?

7. **Common Questions and Edge Cases** (Completion)
   - "What if...?" questions
   - Troubleshooting
   - Misunderstandings to avoid

8. **Getting Started** (Action)
   - Concrete entry point
   - Small, achievable first step
   - Path to deeper engagement

## Hierarchy and Emphasis

- Top-level headings (##) should be major conceptual sections
- Sub-headings (###) break concepts into digestible chunks
- **Bold** highlights key terms and definitions
- Code blocks show concrete examples
- Lists emphasize relationships and options
- Indentation and spacing improve scanability

## Pedagogical Principles

- Concrete before abstract (or abstract WITH concrete simultaneously)
- Known before unknown (build on what LLM likely knows)
- Simple before complex (establish foundation before nuance)
- Example-driven (show what you mean, don't just tell)
- Repetition with variation (reinforce key concepts in different contexts)
- Explicit connections (state how pieces relate)
