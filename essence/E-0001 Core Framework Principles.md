# Core Framework Principles

## Claim: Framework is knowledge organization, not document writing

The framework's primary purpose is knowledge organization with separation of concerns, not document writing.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0005 Separation of Concerns]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 clarifies the purpose shift from writing-focused to knowledge-organization-focused. S-0005 establishes separation of concerns as the foundational principle.

## Claim: Knowledge organization creates independent value

Knowledge organization creates value independent of any specific output.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 notes that organized knowledge has intrinsic value. S-0004 shows the framework helps organize existing knowledge even before producing new expressions.

## Claim: Expression includes documents, decisions, and actions

Expression is how you apply organized knowledge. This includes documents, decisions, actions, and principles-in-practice.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 explicitly broadens expression beyond documents. S-0004 shows expressions are natural outputs of thinking and communication.

## Claim: Expressions naturally serve as inputs

Expressions naturally serve as inputs to the framework. The framework helps organize existing expressions, not start from pristine substrate.

**Supports:** [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0004 establishes that knowledge enters as expressions (conversations, documents). The framework distills existing expressions rather than requiring perfect substrate first.

## Claim: Separation of concerns improves maintainability

Separation of concerns (facts, meaning, communication) improves maintainability and enables multiple uses.

**Supports:** [[S-0005 Separation of Concerns]], [[S-0002 Resume Use Case]], [[S-0003 Document Evolution]]

**Rationale:** S-0005 establishes the separation principle from software engineering. S-0002 shows same facts can produce multiple resumes. S-0003 shows mixing concerns causes degradation over time.

## Claim: Framework mirrors deep learning

The framework mirrors how deep learning works: absorb expression → extract components → synthesize understanding.

**Supports:** [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0004 notes that learning something thoroughly requires breaking it down. The framework systematizes this natural learning process.

## Key Terms

**Knowledge Organization**: Systematic structuring of information with separation of concerns to enable traceability, multiple uses, and maintenance.

**Separation of Concerns**: Architectural principle where distinct aspects (facts, meaning, presentation) are kept independent to reduce coupling.

**Expression as Input**: The natural flow where knowledge enters the system as expressions (conversations, documents) that are then organized.

## Invariants

- Knowledge organization must precede optimal expression
- Expressions can be both inputs and outputs
- Value exists at each layer independently
