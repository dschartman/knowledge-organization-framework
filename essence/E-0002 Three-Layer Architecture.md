# Three-Layer Architecture

## Claim: Three distinct layers

The framework organizes knowledge into three distinct layers:
- **Substrate** (facts)
- **Essence** (meaning)
- **Expression** (communication/application)

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0005 Separation of Concerns]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 defines the three-part separation. S-0005 establishes separation of concerns as the architectural foundation.

## Claim: Substrate contains immutable observations

The substrate layer contains immutable, verifiable observations and evidence without interpretation.

**Supports:** [[S-0002 Resume Use Case]], [[S-0003 Document Evolution]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0002 shows career facts as a substrate example. S-0003 demonstrates the need for a stable factual foundation. S-0004 notes that expressions enter as input but must be distilled to substrate.

## Claim: Essence contains meaning and relationships

The essence layer contains abstract, auditable meaning derived from substrate. This includes principles, claims, interpretations, and **relationships between concepts**.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]], [[S-0007 Essence Relationships]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 clarifies that essence is where meaning lives. S-0004 shows essence emerges from breaking down expressions into components. S-0007 establishes that relationships and ordering are critical parts of essence.

## Claim: Expression instantiates essence for contexts

The expression layer instantiates essence for specific contexts. This includes documents, decisions, actions, and behaviors.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0002 Resume Use Case]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 expands expression beyond documents. S-0002 shows resumes as an expression example. S-0004 establishes expressions as natural communication artifacts.

## Claim: Each layer creates independent value

Each layer creates value independently. Organized substrate and essence have value even without expression artifacts.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]], [[S-0005 Separation of Concerns]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 states that knowledge organization creates independent value. S-0004 shows understanding emerges from organizing. S-0005 shows separated concerns enable independent evolution.

## Claim: Same knowledge yields multiple expressions

The same substrate and essence can produce multiple different expressions for different contexts, audiences, or purposes.

**Supports:** [[S-0002 Resume Use Case]]

**Rationale:** S-0002 explicitly notes that the same career facts can generate different resumes for different roles (data engineer vs. software engineer).

## Claim: Essence captures concept relationships and ordering

Essence captures relationships between concepts and their ordering dependencies, not just isolated claims.

**Supports:** [[S-0007 Essence Relationships]]

**Rationale:** S-0007 establishes that teaching, decision-making, and coherent reasoning require understanding concept dependencies and proper ordering. Random ordering of valid information makes it incomprehensible.

## Layer Definitions

### Substrate Layer
**Purpose:** Immutable inventory of verified observations and evidence

**Content:** Observable facts with provenance

**Characteristics:**
- Append-only
- No interpretation
- Traceable sources

**Examples:** Career accomplishments, research data, life experiences, meeting transcripts

### Essence Layer
**Purpose:** Abstract, auditable model of significance derived from substrate, including relationships and ordering

**Content:** Claims, principles, interpretations, terminology, concept relationships, dependencies

**Characteristics:**
- Traceable to substrate
- Abstract and generalizable
- Can evolve
- Captures relationships and ordering

**Examples:** Core principles, value propositions, design philosophy, prioritization criteria, concept dependencies, prerequisite orderings

**Note:** Relationships between concepts are as important as the concepts themselves. Essence captures both what matters and how things relate.

### Expression Layer
**Purpose:** Context-specific instantiation of essence

**Content:** Documents, decisions, actions, behaviors aligned with essence

**Characteristics:**
- Audience-specific
- Can be regenerated
- Emits meta-feedback

**Examples:** Documentation, resumes, strategic decisions, principles-in-practice

## Layer Relationships

**Substrate → Essence:** Interpretive but verifiable (essence must cite substrate)

**Essence → Expression:** Representational (expression renders essence without modifying it)
