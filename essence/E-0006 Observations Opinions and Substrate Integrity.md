# Observations, Opinions, and Substrate Integrity

## Claim: Substrate contains only verifiable facts, not unsupported opinions

Substrate must maintain integrity by containing only observable, verifiable facts—whether knowledge (things that change) or wisdom (things that don't change).

**Supports:** [[S-0011 Observation vs Opinion Distinction]]

**Rationale:**
- Opinions presented as observations contaminate substrate with unverified claims
- Examples like "liberals lack emotional control" are interpretations, not observations
- True observations require measurable criteria and verifiable context
- Substrate integrity depends on this distinction

## Claim: Opinions belong in essence, not substrate

Opinions, interpretations, and claims should be organized in the essence layer where they can evolve as understanding grows.

**Supports:** [[S-0011 Observation vs Opinion Distinction]]

**Rationale:**
- Essence is where interpretation happens
- Essence explicitly acknowledges these are claims/judgments, not facts
- As learning progresses, essence can be updated; substrate remains stable
- This honest separation maintains framework integrity

## Claim: Substrate includes both knowledge and wisdom

Substrate appropriately contains both:
- **Knowledge:** Facts that change over time (current understandings, current state of the world)
- **Wisdom:** Principles and truths that do not change over time

**Supports:** [[S-0011 Observation vs Opinion Distinction]]

**Rationale:**
- Both are verifiable and observable in appropriate context
- Knowledge provides specificity and timeliness
- Wisdom provides enduring principles
- Together they form a complete substrate foundation

## Principle: Clear Layer Separation Prevents Contamination

The distinction between observations and opinions is critical for framework integrity.

**Key Dependencies:**
1. **Understanding what constitutes verifiable fact** comes before **identifying observations**
2. **Recognizing interpretation and judgment** comes before **accepting something as substrate**
3. **Clarity on layer boundaries** comes before **effective use of the framework**

## Practical Implications

### How to Evaluate if Something is Substrate or Essence

**Substrate:** "In a sample of 50 news articles from Organization X published in October 2025, 34 contained claims without cited sources."
- Verifiable: You can check the articles
- Observable: Factual count and evidence
- Appropriate for substrate

**Not Substrate:** "Organization X has a political agenda to mislead people."
- This is a claim/interpretation
- It's built FROM substrate facts
- It belongs in essence as an interpreted claim

### Maintaining Integrity When Decomposing Expressions

When breaking down an expression (like a news article):
- Substrate layer: Extract only the verifiable facts presented
- Essence layer: Extract the interpretations, claims, and implicit narratives
- This reveals where the expression is fact-grounded vs. opinion-driven

### Evolution of Understanding

- Substrate remains stable (append-only, new observations added, not replaced)
- Essence evolves as interpretation deepens
- Old essence entries can be marked superseded when new learning changes interpretation
- This honest evolution prevents false certainty while maintaining traceability of thought

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Mixing observations and opinions in substrate
**Problem:** Substrate becomes unreliable and loses integrity
**Solution:** If you find an unsupported claim in substrate, move it to essence where it belongs

### ❌ Treating opinions as substrate because they feel true
**Problem:** Personal conviction does not equal verifiability
**Solution:** Ask: "Can someone independently verify this fact?" If no, it's essence, not substrate

### ❌ Refusing to acknowledge opinions exist
**Problem:** Hidden interpretations are more dangerous than explicit ones
**Solution:** Bring opinions into essence where they can be openly examined and evolved
