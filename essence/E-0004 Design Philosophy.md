# Design Philosophy and Guiding Principles

## Claim: Contradictions are acceptable and valuable

Contradictions in substrate are acceptable and valuable. They signal missing information, nuance, or multiple valid perspectives.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 explicitly states contradictions are features, not bugs. They reflect reality.

## Claim: Expression-driven development

Expression-driven development: the value of creating an expression should drive the process, not pursuit of perfect substrate or essence.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 establishes expression-driven as core philosophy. S-0004 shows expressions are natural starting points.

## Claim: Does it get the job done?

The critical question is always: "Does the expression get the job done?" not "Is it perfect?"

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 explicitly states this as the key decision criterion.

## Claim: Keep it simple

Keep it simple. Over-engineering versioning, composition, or conflict rules should be avoided.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 emphasizes discovering the framework through use rather than prescribing everything in advance.

## Claim: Context determines everything

Context determines everything. How to handle conflicts, contradictions, or edge cases depends on expression purpose.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 notes that answers to "how do you handle X" depend on what you're building and for whom.

## Claim: Framework discovered through use

The framework should be discovered through use (self-hosting), not prescribed in advance.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0004 Expression as Input]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 states this explicitly. S-0004 shows learning happens through practice and synthesis.

## Claim: Errors and imperfections are acceptable

Errors and imperfections at each layer are acceptable and human. Continuous improvement is the goal.

**Supports:** [[S-0001 Framework Purpose]], [[S-0003 Document Evolution]]

**Rationale:** S-0001 explicitly allows errors. S-0003 shows degradation is natural and needs systematic response, not perfection.

## The Four Guiding Principles

### 1. Contradictions Are Features
**Principle:** Conflicting claims from different substrate sources are perfectly acceptable.

**They signal:**
- Missing information or additional research needed
- Inherent nuance or duality in the topic
- Multiple valid perspectives

**Approach:** The essence may surface contradictions or not, depending on expression needs.

**Mindset:** Errors are human and part of continuous improvement.

### 2. Expression-Driven Development
**Principle:** The value of creating an expression should drive the process.

**Key question:** "Does the expression get the job done?"

**Decision tree:**
- Expression gets the job done → Ship it, even if imperfect
- Expression doesn't get job done or doesn't feel right → Regenerate it

**Avoid:** Letting perfect substrate/essence block useful expression.

**Note:** Very rarely should history and essence drive expression. Focus on value and utility.

### 3. Keep It Simple
**Principle:** Don't over-engineer. Discover through use.

**Focus on:**
- Core concepts and organization
- Using framework to develop itself
- Learning what works at different scales
- Nailing fundamental mechanics

**Mindset:** Framework discovered through use, not prescribed in advance.

**Purpose:** This repo exists to develop the framework using the framework.

### 4. Context Determines Everything
**Principle:** Answers depend on expression purpose.

**Questions to ask:**
- What expression are you creating?
- Who is the audience?
- What problem are you solving?

**Example:** Conflicting sources may BE the point (political analysis) or irrelevant (product docs).

**Guidance:** Let expression's purpose guide what matters.

## Practical Implications

**On contradictions:** Don't force resolution. Preserve nuance unless expression requires clarity.

**On perfection:** Ship useful over perfect. Iterate based on actual use.

**On rules:** Start minimal. Add structure only when pain points emerge.

**On errors:** Document them as substrate. Learn from them. Don't hide them.

**On scope:** Start small. Scale up based on what works.
