# Knowledge Organization Framework Skill

## What This Does

This skill helps you apply a three-layer framework to organize knowledge systematically. You decompose information into:

- **Substrate:** Verifiable facts and observations
- **Essence:** Interpreted meaning and relationships between concepts
- **Expression:** Coherent documents, decisions, or communications

The result: better-structured outputs that are verifiable, traceable to facts, and adaptable to different audiences.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Organize complex information** before creating a document, decision, or communication
- **Understand information quality** by separating facts from interpretation and bias
- **Generate multiple outputs** from the same knowledge base (e.g., different resumes from one career history)
- **Improve clarity** by making the connection between facts, meaning, and communication explicit
- **Build verifiable claims** where others can check your work against source material

**Example scenarios:**
- Breaking down a news article to see what's factual vs. opinion-driven
- Organizing research into structured knowledge that supports multiple papers
- Creating a decision with verifiable reasoning from evidence
- Building documentation from scattered notes and sources

## The Three Layers

### Substrate: Verifiable Facts

**What it contains:**
- Observable facts with their context and source
- Data, metrics, specific events, direct quotes
- Experiences and outcomes that can be verified
- Both knowledge (things that change) and wisdom (principles that don't)

**Key principle:** Substrate stays factual. No interpretation, judgment, or unsupported claims.

**Examples:**
- "Customer feedback: 5 of 8 interviewees mentioned difficulty with onboarding"
- "Average task completion time: 23 minutes (measured Oct 2025)"
- "The system processed 1 billion events daily"

**What's NOT substrate:**
- "Onboarding is too hard" (interpretation)
- "Customers hate the setup process" (judgment)
- "We should fix onboarding" (decision/opinion)

### Essence: Meaning and Relationships

**What it contains:**
- Claims and principles that interpret substrate facts
- Relationships between concepts and their ordering
- What matters and why
- How things depend on each other

**Key principle:** Essence must be grounded in substrate, but can interpret and combine facts.

**Examples:**
- Substrate: "5 of 8 customers reported difficulty; competitor average is 5 minutes, ours is 23"
- Essence: "Onboarding time is a primary adoption barrier. The gap suggests structural issues, not minor friction."

**What's different from substrate:**
- Essence adds meaning ("this gap signals a problem")
- Essence connects facts ("these data points together suggest...")
- Essence evolves as understanding deepens (substrate remains stable)

### Expression: Communication

**What it contains:**
- Documents, articles, decisions
- Strategies, action plans, communications
- Anything that puts knowledge to work for a specific purpose and audience

**Key principle:** Expression renders essence for an audience without modifying the essence itself.

**Examples:**
- A decision document recommending onboarding redesign
- A bug report highlighting specific friction points
- A product roadmap prioritizing user experience

**What matters:**
- Different expressions can come from the same essence (tailored for different audiences)
- If expression reveals essence problems, essence gets updated and expression regenerates
- Expression is audience-specific; substance comes from essence

## How the Layers Connect

### Substrate → Essence: Interpretation with Verification

**The rule:** Every essence claim must be verifiable against substrate. You interpret and combine facts, but don't invent claims.

**What this means:**
- You can draw conclusions from data
- You can identify patterns across multiple facts
- You cannot make claims about facts you haven't included in substrate

**If you get stuck:**
- Making a claim with no substrate support? Either add the substrate or remove the claim.
- Uncertain what substrate supports a claim? Rewrite the claim to be clearer about what it requires.

### Essence → Expression: Rendering Without Modification

**The rule:** Expression represents essence accurately for its audience. It doesn't change what essence says, only how it's presented.

**What this means:**
- You can adjust tone, emphasis, and level of detail for your audience
- You can select which parts of essence matter for this expression
- You cannot add new claims or change the meaning

**If expression fails:**
- Expression doesn't solve the problem? Don't patch the expression. Review and update essence, then regenerate.
- Expression feels wrong? The issue is usually in essence clarity, not expression wording.

## How to Apply This Framework

### Step 1: Capture Substrate

Start with what you actually know. Don't aim for perfect organization—capture the raw material first.

**Do this by:**
- Recording facts, observations, data, and sources
- Being specific: "5 customers" not "many customers"
- Noting context: Where does this fact come from? What are its limits?
- Including one distinct fact per entry

**Example structure:**
```
Fact: 5 of 8 customers mentioned difficulty with setup process
Context: Customer interviews, Oct 2025
Source: Interview notes from product team
```

### Step 2: Extract Essence

Once you have substrate, identify what it means.

**Do this by:**
- Looking for patterns across facts
- Stating claims that emerge from the facts
- Noting what substrate supports each claim
- Identifying how concepts relate and depend on each other

**Example:**
```
Claim: Onboarding speed is a primary adoption barrier
Supported by: Substrate facts about customer feedback + competitor comparison
Relates to: User retention (faster onboarding → better retention)
Depends on: Understanding that 23-minute baseline is the problem before proposing solutions
```

### Step 3: Generate Expression

With substrate and essence organized, create the specific output you need.

**Ask yourself:**
- Who is the audience for this expression?
- What is the purpose? (decision, communication, documentation, action)
- Which parts of essence matter for this audience?
- What level of detail is appropriate?

**Then create:**
- The document, decision, communication, or other artifact
- Knowing you can regenerate it if essence changes
- Verifiable back to the substrate and essence that support it

## Key Principles

### Every Word Matters

In organizing knowledge, each term builds on previous ones. Precision in language makes the framework work.

- **Substrate** vs **essence** is a real distinction that affects clarity
- **Verifiable** means "can be checked against facts" (not just "traceable back")
- **Observation** (fact-based) vs **opinion** (interpretation) must be clear
- Consistent terminology throughout prevents confusion

### Expressions are the Primary Interface

Everything communicates through expressions: conversations, documents, feedback.

- The framework does not avoid expressions; it decomposes them
- Starting with an expression (a document, news article, meeting notes) is normal
- The value is: understanding what's fact vs. interpretation, then improving the expression
- This works backwards (expression → understanding) as much as forwards

### Decomposition is Powerful but Unnatural

Breaking down expressions into layers is artificial—but it enables systematic improvement.

- You normally consume information as whole units
- Separating facts, meaning, and communication takes effort
- The payoff: you can verify claims, see bias, and regenerate better expressions

### Context Determines Everything

How strictly you apply boundaries depends on what you're building.

- Scientific paper: substrate/essence distinction matters enormously
- Creative writing: boundaries can be looser
- News analysis: decomposing to find bias is the whole point
- Personal knowledge: what matters is that it works for you

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I start with essence or expression instead of substrate?**

A: Yes. Start wherever the work begins. Analyzing a biased news article? Start with the expression and decompose. Building a decision? The substrate (data) might be your starting point. Let the work guide the flow.

**Q: What if I don't have complete substrate?**

A: That's fine. Make essence claims noting what substrate would strengthen them. Add the missing substrate later. The framework organizes what you know, not a substitute for research.

**Q: Is substrate always facts? Can it include stories or experiences?**

A: Yes to both. Substrate includes observable facts—and personal experiences are observable (to you). "I learned X from this experience" is verifiable substrate. "This experience means Y about humanity" is essence.

**Q: How do I know if something is observation or opinion?**

A: Ask: Can someone independently verify this? If yes, it's potentially substrate. If it requires interpretation or judgment, it's essence. Gray areas are okay—the distinction matters for clarity, not perfection.

**Q: What if essence and substrate disagree?**

A: Keep both. Contradictions often mean: missing information, multiple valid interpretations, or context-dependency. Your essence can acknowledge the contradiction or explain which interpretation matters for your expression.

**Q: Can this work at scale? (hundreds of entries, teams, databases)**

A: The framework itself is scale-agnostic. Implementation might change (database instead of files, custom tools instead of markdown) but core principles remain. Start simple; adapt as you grow.

## Getting Started

1. **Pick a real problem:** something you need to understand, communicate, or decide
2. **Gather what you know:** capture facts, sources, context (substrate)
3. **Find the meaning:** what do these facts tell you? (essence)
4. **Create the output:** document, decision, or communication (expression)
5. **Verify and iterate:** Does it work? What would improve it?

The framework is learned through use. Start small, see what works, adapt to your context.

## When This Framework Shines

- **News/information analysis:** See what's fact vs. opinion vs. bias
- **Decision-making:** Decisions grounded in evidence with clear reasoning
- **Research synthesis:** Understand relationships between sources, not just collect them
- **Documentation:** Docs that improve over time as understanding grows
- **Teaching:** Making what you know explicit and verifiable
- **Complex domains:** Politics, health, science—where bias and interpretation matter

---

## What This Framework Is Not

- Not a guarantee of truth (substrate can contain errors or limited perspectives)
- Not a rigid structure you must follow perfectly (adapt to your context)
- Not a way to avoid interpretation (essence layer is interpretation)
- Not a substitute for domain expertise (framework helps organize expertise, not replace it)
- Not a mechanism for erasing disagreement (contradictions can coexist in substrate/essence)
